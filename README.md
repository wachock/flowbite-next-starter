## Getting Started

`Next.js` requires [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org).

If you don't already have `npm` and `yarn` available, make sure you set them up.

```bash
npm i -g npm yarn
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Now you can run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
